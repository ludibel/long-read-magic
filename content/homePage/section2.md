title: Project goal
description: Our primary goal is to harness the power of advanced computational techniques to unravel the mysteries hidden within metagenomic data. We aim to assemble high-quality genomes (MAGs) to provide a comprehensive view of microbial diversity and functional potential. Through rigorous analysis, we seek to identify novel genes, study gene functions, and uncover evolutionary relationships within these genomes.
